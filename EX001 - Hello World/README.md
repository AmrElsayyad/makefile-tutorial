To run these examples, you'll need a terminal and "make" installed. For each example, put the contents in a file called Makefile, and in that directory run the command make. Let's start with the simplest of Makefiles:

```Makefile
hello:
  echo "Hello, World"
```

Note: Makefiles must be indented using TABs and not spaces or make will fail.

Here is the output of running the above example:

```Shell
$ make
echo "Hello, World"
Hello, World

```
