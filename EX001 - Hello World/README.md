To run these examples, you'll need a terminal and `make` installed. For each example, put the contents in a file called _makefile_, and in that directory run the command make. Let's start with the simplest of _makefiles_:

```make
hello:
  echo "Hello, World"
```

> Note: _makefiles_ must be indented using TABs and not spaces or `make` will fail.

Here is the output of running the above example:

```Shell
$ make
echo "Hello, World"
Hello, World

```
