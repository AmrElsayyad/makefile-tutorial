# Each command is run in a new shell (or at least the effect is as such)

all: 
	cd ..
	# The cd above does not affect this line,
	# because each command is effectively run in a new shell
	echo `pwd`

	# This cd command affects the next because they are on the same line
	cd ..; echo `pwd`

	# Same as above
	cd ..; \
	echo `pwd`
